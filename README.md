🎧 VOICE_APP

Not a voice chat tool.
A living space shaped by presence.

🌀 What is VOICE_APP?

VOICE_APP is an experiment.

It is a room.
It is a presence.
It is an interface that reacts.

This project explores a simple question:

What if voice wasn’t just heard —
but felt through space?

Instead of buttons and panels,
users exist as characters.

Instead of static UI,
the room breathes.

Instead of overwhelming features,
only what is necessary remains.

🎨 Philosophy

I see this as art before product.

Technology here is not the point.
It is a medium.

The goal is not complexity.
The goal is clarity.

Visual feedback should feel alive.

State changes should feel meaningful.

Silence should feel different from activity.

Presence should shape space.

If something does not improve experience,
it does not belong.

🧠 Design Principles

1. Restraint over excess
No feature for the sake of feature.

2. Space over clutter
The room is the interface.

3. State is visible
Idle, active, recording — all reflected visually.

4. Emotion through motion
Subtle animation over loud decoration.

⚙️ Technical Approach

The system is intentionally simple:

Vanilla JavaScript

Canvas 2D for room VFX

Express + WebSocket backend

Redis for state synchronization

PostgreSQL for persistence

Prisma for schema management

No heavy frameworks.
No unnecessary abstractions.

The architecture supports:

Real-time room interaction

Character-based presence

Host-controlled environment themes

Scalable state management

The technology serves the experience — not the other way around.

🌊 Current Exploration

Reactive room wave ring

Character-based UI

Spatial feedback

Visual state transitions

Long-press interaction experiments

This is an evolving system.

🧭 Why Open Source?

Because this is not just a product.

It is an exploration of:

real-time presence

visual minimalism

spatial communication

human-centered interaction

If you are interested in systems that feel alive,
let’s build together.

📌 Status

Alpha-stage.
Stable core.
Actively evolving design language.

🤝 Collaboration

Looking for people interested in:

Real-time systems

Expressive UI

Creative coding

Social experimentation

Not for scaling fast.
For building something intentional.
